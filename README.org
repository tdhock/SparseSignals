* Motivation

For piecewise constant signals with $M$ or $N$ segments defined on $1,
..., L$, ($L >> M >= N$), arithmetic operations can be efficiently
computed in $O(M + N)$ rather than $O(L)$ space and time, using the
fast C code included in this package.

  ## adding two non-overlapping 1-segment signals gives a signal with
  ## 2 segments.
  x <- SparseSignal(1, 2, 5.5)
  x + SparseSignal(4, 10, 3.8) # 2 rows.
  ## subtracting a SparseSignal from itself gives an empty signal.
  none <- x - x
  str(none)
  ## a more complicated example.
  x <- SparseSignal(c(10L, 12L, 14L),
                    c(11L, 13L, 16L),
                    c(  1,   2,   3))
  y <- SparseSignal(c(10L, 12L, 15L),
                    c(11L, 13L, 17L),
                    c( 1, -2,    4))
  x + y
  ## you can also just add vectors, but they need to be length 1 or
  ## the number of segments.
